the Readme.md in the Italy folder in the vault is generated by the database dump? Doesn't really seem like it. We should have an index generated as well probably but things like in progress tasks etc need not be in there. I backup up italy docs and put them somewhere else... do what I ask to improve (ie the index generated) and also do the test again and then also
