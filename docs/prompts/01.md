I am creating a repository of research with the stated goal:

I would like to be able to live and work in an EU country for an extended period

I want to know all of the different ways that I can gain residency in every EU country with a priority of these countries but not limited to


Italy
Denmark
Netherlands
Greece
Norway
Sweden
Switzerland
France
Spain
Portugal
Germany
Belgium
Ireland
Austria (is EU?)
Czech republic possibly

Gaining residency research should be comprehensive but should include 


- Digital Nomad Visas
- real estate based residency and financial related residency
- getting work visas from a company
- starting a business (ie Italian innovative startup residency type thing but others as well)
- citizenship possibilities (ancestors in Italy and Ireland)
- other ways I don't know about

keep in mind that I don't know alot about this and I am relying on you to explore unknown unknowns

This repository loosely will resemble a web scraping project

I would also like to catalogue all sources of information and all sites that we scrape thoroughly. We can use sqlite and several tables for keeping track.

use python

don't make it too complex but make it extensible

we want to catalogue our scraping journey and also the local files that we download and possibly scraping jobs that we do and if they were successful. Overall though I just want coverage of the domain and that's what I care about most: What are all the ways that I can gain residency (or dual citizenship but this is seconddary goal) in the EU.

We can be as detailed documentation wise as possible. I want specific laws, stipulations, regulations, programs, and avanues of residency as possible. I want an easy way to navigate that knowledge base once I create it as well.

In addition I want this repository to be extensible so I may later include research on companies. these companies would companies that would have tech and software engineering jobs.
