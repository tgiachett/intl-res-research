feedback on first pass on italy

can you give me a sample markdown report of whats in our database tables? did the 
workflow succeed in that we have knowledge base, sources for the knowledge, audit and 
other data in our tables? use your cli tools to view the database info 


also I only see one artifact in raw/italy which is a markdown on nomad visas

What are some other options?

what if I get hired by an italian company how does that work?

also what about innovative startup route how does that work?

so far I am finding you are lazy

explore more options and sources

brainstorm ideas and start to fill out our sources

a source might be a site that has multiple sub sources

This needs to have high coverage of ways of gaining residency... this is very low coverage so far
