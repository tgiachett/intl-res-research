so I am noticing something though. our cli tools need work...

basicallly since we have LLMS doing alll this work we want to mimize the tracking ie

they’re unreliable at bookkeeping, strict rule-following, and multi‑step computation—exactly what scrapers must do well.

so our cli tools should be designed around this

for example instaed of having to remember to link sources to pathways and to use the audit table and other tables

each cli command shouldbe a transaction and should insert pathways, sources, and any other tables that need updating all with one command and the same inputs. we should retain the ability to insert into individual tables but only reserve that for situatiosn where data is corrupted and needs repair or something like that.

if we create and organize our cli tools around this principle of least book keeping overhead then we will have much better results I think.

Give me a report on how the agentic system/workflow currently works and how we could improve it to minimize the amount of discrete tracking/bookkeeping the llm has to do and instead bundle as much of thta kind of thing as possible into our llm cli tools.

basically I wouldl llike the llm to do what it excels at

"they’re excellent at messy, language-y tasks (finding/reading/following links, summarizing, brittle DOMs)"

ie searching and gettingj, parsing information data and links

then design the cli tools to do as much lifting as possible per tool call
