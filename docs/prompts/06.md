Lets see if our workflow works with Italy as an example use case

begin the process of researchign and scraping data on Italy residence and citizenship information and begin to create the knowledge base. Make sure to use the cli tools that we setup as you search and scrape using brave search mcp, playwright (if required), and fetch. so every foray into scrapign and gettign the data should be recorded in our tables.

by the end I should have comprehensive coverage knowledge base on italy and also all of the database table data that would accompany that knowledge base as well as the artifacts which may just be markdown files but could be other artifacts.
