LLM agents will be doing all of the work.

using
-  brave search MCP server
- playwright mcp server
- scripts and cli tools made for LLMs and this topic

in addition we should have an append only log doc that you will write to to document the process of solving this problem including issues we ran into and how we solved them. We will also have a domain log which will have a domain specific knowledge base log of things we learned about the domain (EU residency and citizenship).

lastly we should have a doc for each country where we document our tasks todo and done for everthing we did for that country

the done tasks should link to markdown files or other evidence of the work done.


scripts and cli tools made for LLMs and this topic:

we need to create cli tools for you to interact with the databases

we need database init scripts to setup the database

we need cli tools for migrating database tables in case we add or remove cols etc

we need any other cli tools that LLMs can use to manipulate data that we have, scrape the internet in ways we can't do with brave mcp or playwright mcp. At some point we would like this totally automated once we find sources of information so we can refresh data without repeating expensive LLM routines.

plan out the above with todos as well.

I want a master todos list that is apart from the project plan
