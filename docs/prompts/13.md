so if I ask the llm agent to go find pathways using any of the tools, brave search, fetch, or playwright then our new transaction tool can be used as the llmm finds data? it can accomodate all the sources found and record its process and audit all in one transaction while or after it uses those mcp servers and/or does web scraping?
