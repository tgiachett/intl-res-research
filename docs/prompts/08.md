so the 7 pathways... Those are documented only in the database? Are there artifacts for
  all 7 pathways? Remember we want human readable knowledge base with information in
  markdown or other files. the databases can contain duplicates of that information and/or
  metadata but I don't want to have to do database operations every time I want to look at the information

  I guess this is what the reports are for? if so the reports should be better organized and also the date schema for report fiel names is not granular enough to capture intra day collected data

  I like the report but each pathway should also have sources directly linked next to the information and not just all the sources at the top of the page

  record your learnings in the learnings log (ie the process log) its append only... should already exist
