## Key Information to Capture

### For Each Residency Pathway
- Official program name
- Legal basis (law/regulation numbers)
- Eligibility requirements
- Financial requirements
- Documentation needed
- Application process and timeline
- Costs (application fees, legal fees)
- Duration and renewal terms
- Path to permanent residency
- Path to citizenship (if any)
- Restrictions and obligations
- Tax implications
- Healthcare access
- Family members inclusion
- Success rates (if available)

### Source Credibility Levels
1. **Official Government** - Immigration ministry, embassy websites
2. **Legal Sources** - Official legal databases, government gazettes
3. **Verified Professional** - Immigration lawyers, consultants with credentials
4. **Community/Forum** - Reddit, expat forums (cross-reference required)
5. **News/Media** - Reputable news sources

## Tools and Automation

### Scraping Strategy
- **Respectful scraping**: Rate limiting, robots.txt compliance
- **Persistent storage**: Save raw HTML for re-parsing
- **Version tracking**: Track when information was last updated
- **Change detection**: Alert when official sources change

### Data Quality
- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Flag conflicting information
- Track information freshness
- Verify official sources

### Navigation and Access
- Obsidian vault integration
- Tag-based organization
- Search functionality
- Visual relationship maps
- Comparison tables

## Success Metrics
- Coverage: All priority countries researched (15 countries)
- Depth: Minimum 5 pathways per country documented
- Quality: 2+ official sources per pathway
- Usability: Easy navigation and comparison
- Extensibility: Clean architecture for adding companies

## Risk Mitigation
- **Outdated Information**: Include last-updated dates, implement periodic re-scraping
- **Language Barriers**: Use translation tools, note when translation is used
- **Complex Legal Text**: Link to original sources, consider professional review
- **Website Changes**: Store raw content, implement robust parsers
- **Scope Creep**: Focus on residency first, companies later

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Create Obsidian kanban board with specific tasks
3. Set up development environment
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation

## Critical 2025 Updates (Validated via Web Search)

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Active Programs
- **Digital Nomad Visas**: 13+ EU countries offering programs
- **EU Blue Card**: Active across 25 EU countries with updated 2025 salary thresholds
- **Italian Innovative Startup Visa**: Still active (needs deeper research)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Major Policy Changes
1. **Portugal Golden Visa** (Oct 2023): Real estate investment pathway REMOVED
2. **Spain Golden Visa** (April 3, 2025): Real estate investment pathway ENDED
3. **Italian Citizenship by Descent** (May 24, 2025): "Tajani Decree" limits to parent/grandparent only
4. **Greece Golden Visa**: Still active with real estate options (possible changes coming)

### üîç Requires Further Research
- Ireland citizenship by descent rules
- Italian Innovative Startup visa current requirements
- Freelancer/self-employment visas by country
- Student visa work rights and transition pathways
- Country-specific digital nomad visa income requirements

### Key Findings
- **Norway & Switzerland**: Schengen members but NOT EU members (affects certain programs)
- **EU Blue Card**: NOT available in Denmark and Ireland
- **Golden Visas**: Rapidly changing landscape - must track 2025-2026 updates closely
- **Ancestry Citizenship**: Time-sensitive - Italian rules tightened significantly in 2025

## Notes
- Prioritize breadth over depth initially (survey all countries)
- Document as we go (don't wait until end)
- Keep raw data separate from processed data
- Make it easy to add new countries/pathways later
- Consider creating a simple web interface in future phases
- **CRITICAL**: Track policy changes - 2025 has seen major shifts in golden visa and citizenship programs
