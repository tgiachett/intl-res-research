Here’s a practical map of the main, legal ways to get (temporary) residency in the Netherlands, with the exact program names the Dutch Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) uses and links to the primary rules.

# 1) Free-movement (EU/EEA/Swiss)

* **You’re an EU/EEA/Swiss citizen** → you don’t need a residence permit; you may register with the IND/municipality after arrival (e.g., if staying >4 months, register in the BRP). Family members who are non-EU use **Verification against EU law**. ([IND][1])

# 2) Work-based routes (non-EU)

**a) Highly Skilled Migrant (Kennismigrant)**

* Sponsored by an **IND-recognised employer**; must meet **salary thresholds** (adjusted yearly). For 2025 (gross/month, excl. holiday pay): **€5,688** (30+), **€4,171** (<30), **€2,989** (reduced criterion, e.g., after Orientation Year). ([IND][2])

**b) EU Blue Card**

* For highly qualified workers; salary threshold generally aligns with HSM 30+ (**€5,688**) or **€4,551** for recent graduates; contract ≥6 months; offers intra-EU mobility benefits. ([IND][2])

**c) Regular paid employment (Single Permit / GVVA)**

* **GVVA** combines residence + work permit; used when you’re hired for paid employment for >3 months and you’re not in one of the special schemes above. Employer involvement with the Dutch labour authority (UWV) is typical. ([IND][3])

**d) Intra-Corporate Transferee (ICT, Dir. 2014/66/EU)**

* For **managers, specialists, trainees** transferred within a multinational from a non-EU entity to a Dutch branch. Salary and other conditions apply. ([IND][4])

**e) Researcher (Directive (EU) 2016/801)**

* For non-EU researchers hosted by an **IND-recognised research institution**; may also use **short-term mobility** if you already hold a researcher permit in another EU state. ([IND][5])

**f) Orientation Year (“zoekjaar”) for highly educated persons**

* 1-year job-seeking/entrepreneurship permit after graduation/PhD/research (Dutch or certain foreign institutions). Often used as a bridge to HSM with **reduced salary criterion**. ([IND][6])

**g) Start-up visa (1 year)**

* For **innovative startups** with an approved **facilitator/mentor**; after the year you can switch to **Self-employed** (zzp) if you meet its tests. ([IND][7])

**h) Self-employed (including DAFT & Japan treaty)**

* Standard route uses an **RVO points-based test** (business plan, personal experience, added value). There’s also a **treaty route** for **US (DAFT)** and **Japan** nationals with lighter criteria (still need **substantial capital**, typically **≥€4,500** depending on business form). ([IND][8])

> IND’s official “Work” overview page links all of the above work permits in one place. ([IND][3])

# 3) Study routes

**Students (higher education / MBO)**

* Institution must be an **IND-recognised sponsor**; you study **full-time** in an **accredited** programme and **maintain progress** (generally ≥50% of credits/year). After study, many apply for the **Orientation Year**. ([IND][9])

# 4) Family/partner routes

**Partner/spouse/children**

* Live with a partner or join family in NL subject to relationship, cohabitation, income and other requirements. (Separate rules for refugees’ family reunification.) ([IND][10])

**Family of EU citizen (incl. Dutch who exercised EU rights)**

* **Verification against EU law** assesses eligibility under free-movement rules for non-EU family members. ([IND][11])

**Parent of Dutch minor (“Chávez-Vilchez”)**

* Residence based on caring for a **minor Dutch child**; now treated as **non-temporary** residence for permanence purposes. ([IND][12])

# 5) Cultural exchange / other

* **Au pair** (via **IND-recognised agency**; max ~30 hours/week of light household/childcare with board/lodging). ([IND][13])
* **Working Holiday (WHP/WHS)** (ages 18–30; participating countries include **Argentina, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Uruguay**; annual caps for some nationalities). ([IND][14])

# 6) Protection (asylum)

* Apply for **asylum** in NL if you need protection; successful applicants receive an **asylum residence permit** (rules on duration and family reunification are subject to ongoing legislative debate in 2024–2025—check status before applying). ([IND][15])

# 7) From temporary stay to permanent stay

* After **5 years of lawful residence**, many can apply for **Permanent Residence** (either **Dutch indefinite** or **EU long-term resident** status), subject to conditions like stable income and **civic integration**. Some statuses qualify sooner in specific cases. ([IND][16])

---

## How the **entry process** works (MVV/TEV)

* For many nationalities/purposes you first obtain an **MVV** (provisional residence visa) and residence permit together via the **TEV** procedure; often your Dutch **sponsor** (employer, school, partner) starts it. ([IND][17])

---

## Quick chooser (rule-of-thumb)

* **Hired by a Dutch employer with a good offer?** → **HSM** or **EU Blue Card** (if you meet diploma/contract rules) → later Permanent/EU Long-Term. ([IND][2])
* **Recent graduate/PhD?** → **Orientation Year** → then **HSM** with reduced salary threshold. ([IND][6])
* **Found your own company?** → **Start-up** (1 year) → **Self-employed**; **US/Japan citizens** can use **DAFT/Japanese treaty**. ([IND][7])
* **Joining a partner/family?** → **Partner/family** permit (or **Verification against EU law** if partner is EU/EEA/Swiss). ([IND][10])
* **Researcher/ICT transfer?** → **Researcher (2016/801)** or **ICT (2014/66/EU)**. ([IND][5])
* **Study** → **Student permit** via recognised institution. ([IND][9])
* **Au pair / 18–30 cultural year** → **Au pair** or **WHP/WHS**. ([IND][13])
* **Protection need** → **Asylum**. (Check current law.) ([IND][15])

---

### Notes & pitfalls

* **Thresholds/fees change mid-year**: Always check IND’s “required amounts” and “fees” pages before filing. ([IND][18])
* **Recognised sponsor** status matters (faster processing and eligibility for several routes). See each permit page under “Work”. ([IND][3])
* **Integration**: For permanent residence or naturalisation you generally must pass **civic integration** (with exemptions/alternatives). ([IND][19])

If you tell me your situation (citizenship, goal: work, study, partner, start a business, etc.), I can map it to the exact permit, MVV/TEV needs, current salary/financial thresholds, and a step-by-step filing plan with forms.

Short version: the Dutch **Start-up** permit is designed to be **pre-revenue**. You don’t need to show business income; you must show **sufficient means to live for the year** **and** have a recognised **facilitator** plus a solid **step-by-step plan**. After that year you normally **switch to the Self-employed (zzp) permit**, which *does* look at business viability and (for 2025) expects roughly **€1,697.82 gross profit/month** along with an **RVO points assessment**. ([IND][1])

# What the Start-up route actually requires

* **No revenue target.** IND does not require sales or profit during the start-up year. Instead, you must prove **income for living costs** (e.g., bank balance in a Dutch account or your facilitator finances your stay). ([IND][1])
* **Step-by-step plan (business plan) assessed by RVO.** Must describe org structure, roles, legal form, staffing, goals, your innovative product/service, and the rollout plan from idea to company. ([IND][1])
* **Recognised facilitator & registration.** You need a signed contract with an approved **facilitator** and registration in the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (**KvK**). ([IND][1])
* **Proof of means of subsistence.** IND explains acceptable proofs (e.g., Dutch bank statement in your name or notary third-party account; facilitator can finance your stay). Amount is tied to IND’s “required amounts” policy (social-minimum level), not to company revenue. ([IND][1])

# How it differs from **Self-employed (zzp)** after the start-up year

* **Timing:** Start-up is **max 1 year** and cannot be extended; you’re expected to **switch to Self-employed** afterwards (or another route). RVO notes the handover and that a facilitator statement may be needed. ([IND][1])
* **Financial test:** Self-employed applications must meet IND’s **income requirement**; for **2025**, the IND lists **€1,697.82 gross profit per month (incl. holiday allowance)** as the reference figure. ([IND][2])
* **Business viability test:** RVO applies a **points system** across **personal experience, business plan, and added value to NL**; you need sufficient points (e.g., 30 per pillar or 45/45 on two pillars). ([IND][3])

# Do you need an existing company or just a plan?

* You **can start with a plan**: the start-up permit explicitly expects a **plan to go from idea to company**. You do, however, **register** (KvK) and actively build the company during that year under the guidance of your **facilitator**. Pre-revenue is fine during this period as long as you meet the living-cost requirement. ([IND][1])

# Quick decision guide

* **Pre-revenue, innovative idea, mentor in place?** → **Start-up permit** (show personal means + facilitator + step-by-step plan). ([IND][1])
* **Operating business with paying clients and projections, no facilitator?** → **Self-employed permit** (meet income level ~€1,697.82/month gross profit in 2025 and pass RVO points). ([IND][3])

If you want, tell me your current status (citizenship, facilitator prospects, cash runway, any Dutch clients), and I’ll map it to: which permit fits now, the exact documents IND expects, and how to structure the step-by-step plan to satisfy RVO’s checklist.

Great questions—here’s the clean recap for the **Start‑up** route vs the **Self‑employed (zzp)** route, with the exact current rules.

---

## 1) **During the Start‑up year**

* **Do you have to make revenue?** **No.** The IND does **not** set a business‑revenue or profit target for the Start‑up permit. Instead, you must prove you have **enough money to live on** for the year (e.g., funds in a Dutch bank or a notary’s third‑party account), or your **facilitator** finances your stay. IND states you must “meet the income requirements” and you can prove this by **showing funds for your entire stay (max 1 year)**; it’s about **means of subsistence**, not company revenue. ([IND][1])

* **What else is required in that first year?**
  A signed agreement with a recognised **facilitator/mentor**, **KvK registration**, and a **step‑by‑step plan** (business plan) that RVO assesses. ([IND][1])

> IND doesn’t publish a unique euro figure just for Start‑up founders; they only require that sufficient funds are available for the whole year. (That’s why you won’t see a “Start‑up = €X/month” line on the IND “Required amounts” page.) ([IND][1])

---

## 2) **What happens after the Start‑up year?**

* The Start‑up permit is **max 1 year** and **cannot be extended**. To stay in the Netherlands after that, you must **switch to another residence purpose**—most commonly **Self‑employed** (zzp). IND also asks for a **declaration from the facilitator** showing you completed **at least 3 months** of mentoring when you switch. ([IND][1])

*(You could also switch to a job route like Highly Skilled Migrant if you get hired, but that’s a different pathway.)* ([IND][2])

---

## 3) **If you switch to Self‑employed, what income is checked?**

* For the **Self‑employed** permit, IND checks two things:

  1. **Business viability** via RVO’s points test (personal experience, business plan, added value). ([IND][3])
  2. **Income level from your business**. The current IND threshold is **“gross profit per month (with holiday allowance) € 1,697.82”** (valid **1 July–31 December 2025**). This refers to **profit from your business**, not turnover (revenue). ([IND][4])

* IND also looks at whether your income is **sustainable** over time and may consider earlier required amounts when assessing fluctuations (i.e., it’s not literally a single‑month snapshot). ([IND][4])

> Your “~€1,600” instinct is close, but the **current** figure is **€ 1,697.82**. These amounts are updated periodically; always check the IND “Required amounts” page before you file. ([IND][4])

---

## 4) Don’t confuse with this separate figure

* You might also see **€ 2,989**/month mentioned online—that’s the salary criterion for **essential start‑up personnel** (employees of a start‑up), **not** for founders on the Start‑up permit and **not** for the Self‑employed route. ([IND][4])

---

### Bottom line

* **Start‑up year:** **No revenue target.** Show **personal means of subsistence** (or facilitator financing) + facilitator + plan + KvK. ([IND][1])
* **After 1 year:** Start‑up **can’t be extended** → switch to **Self‑employed** (or another route). For **Self‑employed**, plan on **~€ 1,697.82 profit/month** (Jul–Dec 2025 level) **and** passing the **RVO points test**. ([IND][1])

If you want, tell me your runway (how many months of living costs you can show today) and where you are with a facilitator and KvK. I can map that to an immediate filing checklist and a realistic timeline to reach the self‑employed thresholds.
