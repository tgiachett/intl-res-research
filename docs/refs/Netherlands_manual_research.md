Here’s a practical map of the main, legal ways to get (temporary) residency in the Netherlands, with the exact program names the Dutch Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) uses and links to the primary rules.

# 1) Free-movement (EU/EEA/Swiss)

* **You’re an EU/EEA/Swiss citizen** → you don’t need a residence permit; you may register with the IND/municipality after arrival (e.g., if staying >4 months, register in the BRP). Family members who are non-EU use **Verification against EU law**. ([IND][1])

# 2) Work-based routes (non-EU)

**a) Highly Skilled Migrant (Kennismigrant)**

* Sponsored by an **IND-recognised employer**; must meet **salary thresholds** (adjusted yearly). For 2025 (gross/month, excl. holiday pay): **€5,688** (30+), **€4,171** (<30), **€2,989** (reduced criterion, e.g., after Orientation Year). ([IND][2])

**b) EU Blue Card**

* For highly qualified workers; salary threshold generally aligns with HSM 30+ (**€5,688**) or **€4,551** for recent graduates; contract ≥6 months; offers intra-EU mobility benefits. ([IND][2])

**c) Regular paid employment (Single Permit / GVVA)**

* **GVVA** combines residence + work permit; used when you’re hired for paid employment for >3 months and you’re not in one of the special schemes above. Employer involvement with the Dutch labour authority (UWV) is typical. ([IND][3])

**d) Intra-Corporate Transferee (ICT, Dir. 2014/66/EU)**

* For **managers, specialists, trainees** transferred within a multinational from a non-EU entity to a Dutch branch. Salary and other conditions apply. ([IND][4])

**e) Researcher (Directive (EU) 2016/801)**

* For non-EU researchers hosted by an **IND-recognised research institution**; may also use **short-term mobility** if you already hold a researcher permit in another EU state. ([IND][5])

**f) Orientation Year (“zoekjaar”) for highly educated persons**

* 1-year job-seeking/entrepreneurship permit after graduation/PhD/research (Dutch or certain foreign institutions). Often used as a bridge to HSM with **reduced salary criterion**. ([IND][6])

**g) Start-up visa (1 year)**

* For **innovative startups** with an approved **facilitator/mentor**; after the year you can switch to **Self-employed** (zzp) if you meet its tests. ([IND][7])

**h) Self-employed (including DAFT & Japan treaty)**

* Standard route uses an **RVO points-based test** (business plan, personal experience, added value). There’s also a **treaty route** for **US (DAFT)** and **Japan** nationals with lighter criteria (still need **substantial capital**, typically **≥€4,500** depending on business form). ([IND][8])

> IND’s official “Work” overview page links all of the above work permits in one place. ([IND][3])

# 3) Study routes

**Students (higher education / MBO)**

* Institution must be an **IND-recognised sponsor**; you study **full-time** in an **accredited** programme and **maintain progress** (generally ≥50% of credits/year). After study, many apply for the **Orientation Year**. ([IND][9])

# 4) Family/partner routes

**Partner/spouse/children**

* Live with a partner or join family in NL subject to relationship, cohabitation, income and other requirements. (Separate rules for refugees’ family reunification.) ([IND][10])

**Family of EU citizen (incl. Dutch who exercised EU rights)**

* **Verification against EU law** assesses eligibility under free-movement rules for non-EU family members. ([IND][11])

**Parent of Dutch minor (“Chávez-Vilchez”)**

* Residence based on caring for a **minor Dutch child**; now treated as **non-temporary** residence for permanence purposes. ([IND][12])

# 5) Cultural exchange / other

* **Au pair** (via **IND-recognised agency**; max ~30 hours/week of light household/childcare with board/lodging). ([IND][13])
* **Working Holiday (WHP/WHS)** (ages 18–30; participating countries include **Argentina, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Uruguay**; annual caps for some nationalities). ([IND][14])

# 6) Protection (asylum)

* Apply for **asylum** in NL if you need protection; successful applicants receive an **asylum residence permit** (rules on duration and family reunification are subject to ongoing legislative debate in 2024–2025—check status before applying). ([IND][15])

# 7) From temporary stay to permanent stay

* After **5 years of lawful residence**, many can apply for **Permanent Residence** (either **Dutch indefinite** or **EU long-term resident** status), subject to conditions like stable income and **civic integration**. Some statuses qualify sooner in specific cases. ([IND][16])

## How the **entry process** works (MVV/TEV)

* For many nationalities/purposes you first obtain an **MVV** (provisional residence visa) and residence permit together via the **TEV** procedure; often your Dutch **sponsor** (employer, school, partner) starts it. ([IND][17])

---

## Quick chooser (rule-of-thumb)

* **Hired by a Dutch employer with a good offer?** → **HSM** or **EU Blue Card** (if you meet diploma/contract rules) → later Permanent/EU Long-Term. ([IND][2])
* **Recent graduate/PhD?** → **Orientation Year** → then **HSM** with reduced salary threshold. ([IND][6])
* **Found your own company?** → **Start-up** (1 year) → **Self-employed**; **US/Japan citizens** can use **DAFT/Japanese treaty**. ([IND][7])
* **Joining a partner/family?** → **Partner/family** permit (or **Verification against EU law** if partner is EU/EEA/Swiss). ([IND][10])
* **Researcher/ICT transfer?** → **Researcher (2016/801)** or **ICT (2014/66/EU)**. ([IND][5])
* **Study** → **Student permit** via recognised institution. ([IND][9])
* **Au pair / 18–30 cultural year** → **Au pair** or **WHP/WHS**. ([IND][13])
* **Protection need** → **Asylum**. (Check current law.) ([IND][15])

### Notes & pitfalls

* **Thresholds/fees change mid-year**: Always check IND’s “required amounts” and “fees” pages before filing. ([IND][18])
* **Recognised sponsor** status matters (faster processing and eligibility for several routes). See each permit page under “Work”. ([IND][3])
* **Integration**: For permanent residence or naturalisation you generally must pass **civic integration** (with exemptions/alternatives). ([IND][19])

If you tell me your situation (citizenship, goal: work, study, partner, start a business, etc.), I can map it to the exact permit, MVV/TEV needs, current salary/financial thresholds, and a step-by-step filing plan with forms.
